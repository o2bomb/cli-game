# OOSE Assignment
This is my assignment for OOSE. It is a turned-based combat game that utilizes various object-oriented design patterns in its implementation.

## How to run the game
In order for the game to work, you must have the JDK installed. This game was built using openjdk 11.0.7, on a machine running Ubuntu 18.04:
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `javac Application.java`. This will compile all the .java files associated with the project
2. Run the command `java Application`. The game should now start

Note: Run the game with the terminal window at its full height, or some of the information displayed will be cut-off.
